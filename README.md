## Project Description

Developing a student grade system in which a teacher would be able to edit, add, update, or delete a student from their system. The new student would then be stored in the database (MongoDB) with a randomized ID and an empty grade space for the teachers to update/add a new grade. The program will simulate showing all of a student's information regarding their full name, ID, and current grades. When deleting a student, this will be program will be designed to remove a student from the database.

## Technologies Used

* Coding program: Pycharm - Community edition
* Storage Database: MongoDB Compass 

## Features

* A login system for the teacher to help prevent easy access to the database and student information

* Developing a student grade system in which a teacher would be able to edit, add, update, or delete a student from their system.

* The teacher would be able to add a new student, with it, a new randomized ID would be generated for that student by typing "Add", along with a blank grade until it is inserted.

* the teacher would also be able to change the grade of the student by typing "Update", along with getting the full information of the student using the "View" option.

* In order to Delete a student, they would need to type "Delete" and a list of the available students will show. The teacher would need to input the students ID, Which is provided when they list is shown.

## To-do list:

* insert a new collection for storing new admins/teachers and their logins/passwords
* adding a confirmation before the task of deleting a student from the database is initiated
